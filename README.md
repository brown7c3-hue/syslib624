**My Work So Far**

So far, I have connected Github with my virtual machine (VM), and I have
learned of different text editors. I decided to work with nano for this 
class as it is the most commone text editor. I have learned how to 
start working in my repository after signing back in to my VM by changing
my directory and performing the cat README.md command. 

**About This Repo**

This repository will primarily contain my notes for this course (LIS 624), including 
reminders of specific commands and general reflection on course material.
